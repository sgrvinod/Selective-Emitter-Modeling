#Selective Emitter Modeling 
Wrote this for the Solar Thermal Engineering course at Columbia University.

##Modeled in Python.

##The three questions address, respectively:
1. Modeling thermal emission from the atmosphere
2. Create a selective emitter
3. Perform heat transfer analysis to evaluate cooling performance
